# INS-Model

This is the data model repository for the Bento-based [Index of NCI Studies (INS)](https://studycatalog.cancer.gov/).

This model is used alongside the latest version of the [INS-Data](https://github.com/CBIIT/INS-Data) repository, which gathers and prepares data for INS.

For more information about the Bento Graph Model Description Format (MDF) used here, please see the [Bento-MDF](https://github.com/CBIIT/bento-mdf) repository.
